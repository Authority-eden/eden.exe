        Your workspace is made of our collected data logs, which require
        constant upkeep.
        <br />
        You must browse through them and find the compromised values â€” sequences
        of 6 numbers. They will show up exclusively horizontally, from left to
        right; once hovered, they will react noticeably and should not be too
        hard to recognize. Once detected, they must be selected and promptly
        deleted.
        <br />
        <br />
        For today, you will have to find 6 sequences. You will only be able to
        proceed once all the corrupted data is filtered; you can check the
        bottom of the screen to keep tabs on your progress.
