          Your workspace is made of our collected data logs, which require
          constant upkeep. You must browse through them and find the compromised
          values â€”
          <span className={styles.highlight}> sequences of 6 numbers</span>.
          They will show up exclusively{" "}
          <span className={styles.highlight}>horizontally</span>, from left to
          right
          {/* ; once hovered, they will react noticeably and should not be too
          hard to recognize */}
          . Once detected, they must be selected and promptly deleted.
          <br />
          <br />
          For today, you will have to find 6 sequences. You will only be able to
          proceed once all the corrupted data is filtered; you can check the
          bottom of the screen to keep tabs on your progress.
