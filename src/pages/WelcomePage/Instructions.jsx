          Your workspace is built from our collected data logs, which require
          constant maintenance. Your task is to scan through them and identify
          corrupted entries â€”
          <span className={styles.highlight}> sequences of 6 numbers.</span>{" "}
          These sequences will appear{" "}
          <span className={styles.highlight}> only horizontally.</span> Once
          detected, they must be selected and promptly deleted.
          <br />
          <br />
          For today, you will have to find{" "}
          <span className={styles.highlight}>6 corrupted sequences</span>. You
          will only be able to proceed once all the data is filtered. You can
          check the bottom of the screen to keep tabs on your progress.
